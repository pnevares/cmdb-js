Hi! :wave: First, thanks for taking a look at this project and the contributing guidelines.

I welcome pull requests for any open issues or cards on the Kanban board, if it's not already _In progress_.

If you'd like to ask questions, feel free to open a new issue. If you'd like to suggest an update, let's talk!

Let's all be cool. :v:
